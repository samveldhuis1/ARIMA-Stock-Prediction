### ARIMA for Stock Prediction
This R script is designed to utilize ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for predicting stock price movements based on historical data. The script employs various R packages to handle data manipulation, visualization, and ARIMA modeling effectively. 

### Requirements 
tidyverse, quantmod, tidyquant, tseries, timeSeries, forecast, and xts
  
### Usage 
The main function in this script, analyze_stock(), takes a stock ticker symbol as input and performs the following operations: 
 
Retrieves stock price data from Yahoo Finance for the specified ticker symbol, starting from January 1, 2020, to October 25, 2023. You can adjust the dates however you want. 
Plots the closing prices of the stock. 
Graphs the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to help in determining the parameters for ARIMA models. 
Conducts an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity. 
Fits different ARIMA models to the data, including an automatically selected model and custom models. 
Plots the residuals of the fitted models to assess their fit. 
Forecasts future stock prices using the fitted models and plots these forecasts. 
Prints the accuracy of each forecast to help evaluate model performance. 
To analyze a stock, simply call the analyze_stock() function with the ticker symbol as its argument.  
 
### Output 
The script outputs several plots including the stock's closing prices, ACF and PACF plots, residual plots for the fitted ARIMA models, and forecasts for future stock prices. Additionally, it prints the ADF test result and the accuracy of each forecast model. 
 
### Note 
The predictive accuracy of ARIMA models can vary greatly with different stocks and time periods. It's important to carefully consider the model parameters and the results of the ADF test when interpreting the forecasts generated by this script.
